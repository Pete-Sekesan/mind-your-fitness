This app was created to allow users to have a small, standalone application to log and keep track of their exercise's and to view them all in one central location. Setting up an account is easy. Just create a user name and password and you will be able to select from a list of predefined workouts. If you want to take a look around as well, you can log in with our Demo Account to give it a shot.
